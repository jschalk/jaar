## 0.0 About jaar

`jaar` is a python library for listening to the climate of a community. Individual 
positions are aggregated by a listener into a coherant goal that can include promises 
of actions and/or promises of being. Listening and acting on it.

A healer's goal in the community is built by the the weighted intreprtation of
1. Other healers goals 
2. Their own independent goal

Each goal is saved as a JSON file. 

This is currently a one-man projeect.

 
### 1.0 Installing `jaar`

<!-- TODO: add dependencies -->

Future enhancement: `jaar` can be installed using `pip`

<!-- TODO: Get pip install working 

    pip install jaar

If you have installed `jaar` before, and you want to ensure `pip` downloads the latest version (rather than using its internal cache) you can use the following commands:

    pip uninstall jaar
    pip install --no-cache jaar

-->

### 1.1 Hello 

<!-- TODO: Add simplest example

Should examples be found in a separate repository to ensure the `jaar` repository stays 
relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, 
screenshots and explanatory text.

## 1.3 Test-Driven-Development

Jaar was developed using Test-Driven-Development so every feature should have a test
that could represent an example. Tests can be hard to understand. Some tests have many 
variables and can be hard to follow.
