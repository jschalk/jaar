## 0.0 About jaar

`jaar` is a python library for listening to the climate of a community. Individual 
positions are aggregated by a listener into a coherant agenda that can include tasks 
to do and tasks of  of existence. Listening and acting on it.

A agents's agenda in the community is built by the the massed intreprtation of
1. Acct agents agendas 
2. Their own independent agenda

Each agenda is saved as a JSON file. 

This is mostly a one man projeect. Femi has significantly helped. 

 
### 1.0 Installing `jaar`

<!-- TODO: add dependencies -->

Future enhancement: `jaar` can be installed using `pip`

<!-- TODO: Get pip install to function correctly

    pip install jaar

If you have installed `jaar` before, and you should ensure `pip` downloads the latest version (rather than using its internal cache) you can use the follow ing commands:

    pip uninstall jaar
    pip install --no-cache jaar

-->

### 1.1 Hello 

<!-- TODO: Add simplest example

Should examples be found in a separate repository to ensure the `jaar` repository stays 
relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, 
screenshots and elucidatory text.

## 1.3 Test-Driven-Development

Jaar was developed using Test-Driven-Development so every feature should have a test. 
Tests can be hard to comprehend. Some tests have many variables and can be hard to follow.
