test_wheel_contents.py — Builds the wheel and confirms expected files are inside.

Usage:
    pytest test_wheel_contents.py -v -s

Run from the project root (same directory as pyproject.toml).
This test is slow (it builds the wheel) so keep it out of your default
test run and invoke it explicitly before publishing.
